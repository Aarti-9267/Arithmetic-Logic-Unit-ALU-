In this project, a 4-bit ALU in Verilog is designed to handle arithmetic and logic operations with a modular approach. Simulated and verified functionality using Vivado, ensuring accurate results and clean synthesis. Deployed the design on a ZedBoard with switch-controlled input and LED output for real-time testing.
Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) doesn’t just add or subtract numbers — it's what allows your processor to:
1. Perform calculations in calculators and CPUs
2. Make decisions in control systems (like checking if a value is greater or smaller)
3. Execute commands in robotics and automation# Arithmetic-Logic-Unit-ALU-
Implemented Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) on the ZedBoard (Zynq-7000)!
